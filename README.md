# Railway_ticket_booking
This project implements a command-line based railway ticket booking system using Python. 

# This program simulates booking train tickets. It has four classes: Train, Passenger, Ticket and Account.

# The Train class represents a train with its train number, source, destination, and the number of seats available. It has methods to display the train information and book tickets.

# The Passenger class represents a passenger with their name, age, gender, and phone number. It has a method to display passenger information.

# The Ticket class represents a ticket with the train, source, destination, passengers, and PNR (Passenger Name Record) number. It has a method to display ticket information.

# Class called Account is defined with a constructor that takes two arguments: username and password. The class also defines a method called check_password which takes a single argument password and returns a boolean indicating whether the input password matches the stored password.
